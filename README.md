# Homicide Report
![Homicide Report Tests](https://api.travis-ci.org/denverpost/homicide-report.png)
The Homicide Report code takes a google spreadsheet and filters it into various CSVs, JSONs and JSONPs, which are then FTP'd to a production server. It also has rudimentary publishing tools for a homicide list and homicide map.

# Project Setup
The back-end, spreadsheet-publishing portion assumes these environment variables:
```
# The spreadsheet user account
export ACCOUNT_USER='user@gmail.com'
# The spreadsheet user's account key
export ACCOUNT_KEY=''
# The production FTP server's user, directory the files will be uploaded to, and hostname.
export FTP_USER=''
export REMOTE_DIR=''
export REMOTE_HOST=''
```
